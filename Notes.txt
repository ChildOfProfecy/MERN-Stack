Step 1:- Create 2 folder backend and frontend then make 2 files server.js and app.js in backend 
Step 2:- npm init in the main directory name the project,entry point -> backend/server.js
Step 3 :- install npm i exxpress mongoose dotenv
Step 4: Create config folder and in it create config.env and use it for all your variables
Step 5: Create 2 folders 1.Controllers,2.Route then in 1 create productControllers.js and in 1 create productRoute.js
write an export function in controller to "getAllProducts" and import it in routes to route it to the function and then import route
in app.js.

This is your initiation function created..

Now we connect our database
Step 6: Create a database.js file in config folder(any folder is fine) and write the connection code inside a function and export it
 then call that function in server.js and done


Step 7: Now we create our product Model here we define what are the required criterias of our product when adding a new one,
create a model folder in backend and in that create productModel to define your products model

Step 8:We set up all the methods for product management i.e. All the CURD Operations in the controllers.js file and give routes to all
of them in routes file

Step 9: After this we check it in postman and add a new folder for our work as we will use it a lot.

Step 10:Now we add all the errorHandlers that are:
    1.Normal Backend Error,
    2.Async Error,
    3.Unhandled Promise Rejection
    4.Uncaught Exception
    5.MongoDB Error


Step 11: Now we add an api for searching,Filtering and pagination(i.e. number of product on 1 page) this api will take care of all the 
searching.

Step 12:Now we download a bunch for required tools "npm i bcryptjs jsonwebtoken validator nodemailer cookie-parser body-parser"

Step 13: Now Similar to Product we will create a user Model route and contoller with functions:
    1.Register
